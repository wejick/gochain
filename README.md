# ü§î What is this?
Inspired by [langchain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) to provide composability when building Large Language Model Application. GoChain mission is to bring langchain concept to Go in idiomatic way.

This Library will help on many usecases, such as :

## Notice
1. Don't use it if you have better option
1. GoChain priority is golang idiomatic. So eventhough it happily use many langchain concept, don't expect exactly the same behavior as this is not reimplementation.
